I also enjoy sports, playing video games, and reading in\r\nmy free time.\r\nAbout this Project\r\nThis project, Global Internet Usage is made up of a\r\nmultitude interactive or animated plots and models. This was made as my\r\nfinal project for the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Institutes Introduction to\r\nData Science Course.\r\nGoals\r\nContinue my journey into the world of Data Science\r\nPractice making larger projects which are easily acessible\r\nonline\r\nPractice using Distill and Modeling techniques to apply what I’ve\r\nlearned\r\nObserve Gapminder and Country Internet data in a meaningful way\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This\r\nwill be done through several plots from maps to faceted scatter plots.\r\nI’ll also be predicting information about country’s using models based\r\noff of the factors mentioned earlier. Feel free to explore the different\r\npages and take a look at your favorites. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To read more about this and use it in your own\r\nprojects see the “gapminder” hyperlink above.\r\nSource 3\r\nSource 3 was the rnaturalearth\r\npackage which allowed me to create the World GDP Map.
